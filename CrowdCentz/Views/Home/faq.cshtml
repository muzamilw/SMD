                </h1>
                <p>
                    We’ve listed the most frequently requested objectives business have when it comes to marketing online and how they can achieve them using the crowdcentz platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Free marketing stuff ;)

                    <li>
                        You only get charged the ‘ad click’ after app users have successfully watched your video in full and answered your video or won a game.  This means you actually increase your branding regardless of them answering your quiz question – free branding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Crowdcentz takes no commission for re-directing app users to any of your landing page URL – free conversion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each ‘Deal’ can have a separate landing page link to highlight different call for actions or simply to take users to the right purchasing, or booking, or check availability page – multiple free conversion.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Important difference between Crowdcentz, Facebook and Google ads
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crowdcentz ad click charge is not the same as a Google ad word PPC charge or a Facebook ad charge.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We operate in a very different way. <br />

                            1 ad click delivers you 100% conversion compared to most other platforms.  In fact we could argue you get more than 500 - 600% conversion ROI for a single click charge e.g.
